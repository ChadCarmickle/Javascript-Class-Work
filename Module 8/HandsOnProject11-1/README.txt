Welcome to your first Asyncronous Javascript And XML file.


Before you can proceed to get anything to work, 
we need to do some work on
your files.



First you will need to open the createDatabase.php file in some sort 
of 
text editor 

` Warning: this file will no run on your PC 
unless you have a
special program that allows for computing HTMP files. 

Most of these are
blank outputs anyway as there is no input on them; also
the reason we are
here.  In the createDatabase.php you will need to read through the comments
to 
find where you need to put in your Ivy Tech screen name. 

(It should be
around line 5 in most files,
and definitely in the Database creation file).
Also make sure line 6 also has your Ivy Tech Screen Name, 
but with
"_AJAX_DB" added at the end

Once you have modified that file, 
all you need to do is copy it, 
and all
the contents of the objects file folder to the bobbi server.  

Now, open the 
file through your browser. 
It wont look pretty, but it should make and/or
remake all the SQL files you 
are trying to communicate with.

If the following appears as described, you 
will be safe to move on.  The
output should somewhat like the following: 

Start DB work Database
connected.


"Zip Code." 
Then another couple lines describing the SQL on the server side
After "state char(2) NO" 
there should be 5 more lines that look similar.
These are the actual data that was put into
 the SQL files.

"Product Creation" Again, how the table SQL appears. 

(About 10 lines worth)
Another
 5 entries out of the database. (The fifth entry should look like:
"161 ABCD1234 Higgs Boson EA 3 77.00 259.95 1 30 0 ")

"Typing 
Creation" A fair few lines no how the SQL appears Then 5 entries
into the typing database

"AJAX basic Creation." SQL table 
description Another 5 lines of enties(this
 was cut off due to the amount of information that would be put out).
